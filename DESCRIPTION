Title: Circadian mRNA Kinetic Model Fit
Version: 1.0
Author: Jingkui Wang
Maintainer: Jingkui Wang <lengfei5@gmail.com>
Description: This R package is fitting circadian (temproal) profiles of pre-mRNA and mRNA with a kineticc model,
    dissecting the contributions of rhythmic transcription and mRNA degradation 
    and finally inferring mRNA kineitc parameters, e.g. half-life, rhythmic amplitude and phase of rhythmic degradation.
